## Key Observations

- DNS queries observed prior to HTTP communication
- Cleartext HTTP traffic identified using TCP stream analysis
- ICMP echo requests and replies confirm host connectivity
- TCP SYN packets highlight connection initiation behavior
- Protocol hierarchy shows dominant traffic patterns

## SOC Relevance

These findings align with SOC L1 responsibilities such as traffic triage,
packet inspection, and identifying potential reconnaissance or insecure
communication.
